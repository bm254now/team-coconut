## Features

**User authentication**
- Users are created and stored in a MongoDB collection. 
- On login, a jsonwebtoken is given to the user in an httpOnly cookie
- Verify the jwt on every subsequent request, otherwise redirect to login route
- The jwt is also checked on socket connections through a socket.io middleware

**Video chat**
- Used the [simple-peer](https://github.com/feross/simple-peer) library to implement WebRTC protocols for handling user streaming data
- Used Socket.io to handle signalling events between each client to establish peer to peer connections
- Established a [mesh network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh_networking) through socket.io signalling events and simple-peer library methods to create group video calls (in short, all clients need to create connections to one another â€” not have client 1 -> client 2 -> client 3 -> client 4 -> client 1)

**Real time multiplayer gameplay**
- All game logic for a particular game instance is handled in server memory
- Used several socket.io events and React's Context API to maintain a consistent gameplay experience and to display all relevant information in the UI

## Demo

**Login/Sign up and Creating/Joining Games**
1. Create a new account or login to the application. You can either host a game or join an existing game with a game ID (given to you by the host) or you can join through an invite link in an email.

**Playing the game**
1. When the game starts, click on the **settings button at the top right** and you can stream your video camera and your microphone to the other players in the game.

2. Play the game! There's two phases, a clue giving phase and a guessing phase. Submit a clue and hope that you don't accidentally enter the same clue as another player.

3. If you do, that clue is marked as invalid and you won't get any points if the guesser is correct for a round. There are four rounds, so each player gets to guess once.

4. Every player can see if someone has started tying or if they already submitted a clue.

5. At the end of the game, you can either leave or the host can choose to create a new game. Anyone that is still in the game session when the host presses **Play Again** will be redirected to a new pre-game lobby.
